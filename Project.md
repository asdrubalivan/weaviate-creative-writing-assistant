**Project Plan: Creative Writing Assistant**

---

*Note: This document is structured with checkboxes to facilitate progress tracking. Tools like Cursor AI can be used to automatically update and manage these checkboxes as tasks are completed.*

### **Objective**
To develop a creative writing assistant that suggests story ideas using a vector database (Weaviate) and LangGraph for interactive and iterative workflows. The system will integrate human-in-the-loop validation, persistence of ideas, cycles and branching for refinement, and streaming feedback to demonstrate system reasoning.

---

### **Project Scope**
1. **Core Features:**
    - [X] Generate creative story ideas based on user prompts.
    - [ ] Allow users to approve, reject, or modify generated ideas.
    - [ ] Save approved ideas for later use.
    - [ ] Provide iterative refinement of ideas based on user feedback.
    - [ ] Stream token-by-token responses during idea generation.

2. **Technologies Used:**
    - **Weaviate**: For storing and retrieving semantically similar concepts.
    - **LangGraph**: To handle stateful agent workflows and human-in-the-loop interactions.
    - **Typed CLI**: As the backend interface for command-line interactions.

---

### **Project Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Setup (30 minutes)**
- [X] Install and configure Weaviate locally or via a cloud provider.
- [ ] Set up LangGraph with necessary dependencies.
- [ ] Initialize a Typed CLI project for command-line interactions.

#### **Phase 2: Database Initialization (20 minutes)**
- [X] Define a schema in Weaviate for storing story-related concepts (e.g., themes, genres, and character types).
- [X] Populate Weaviate with sample data for testing (e.g., predefined ideas, literary concepts).

#### **Phase 3: LangGraph Workflow Design (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Create a LangGraph workflow for the following:
  - [ ] **Idea Generation**: Retrieve relevant concepts from Weaviate based on user prompts.
  - [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop Interaction**: Pause execution to allow users to approve or modify generated ideas.
  - [ ] **Refinement**: Use cycles to refine ideas iteratively based on user feedback.
  - [ ] **Branching**: Generate multiple variations of a rejected idea for user selection.

#### **Phase 4: Backend Development (40 minutes)**
- [ ] Integrate Weaviate and LangGraph into Typed CLI commands:
  - [ ] **Command 1**: Generate initial story ideas based on user input.
  - [ ] **Command 2**: Accept user feedback to refine ideas.
  - [ ] **Command 3**: Save approved ideas to the database.
- [ ] Enable streaming for token-by-token feedback during idea generation.

#### **Phase 5: Testing and Debugging (20 minutes)**
- [ ] Test the system end-to-end:
  - [ ] Verify that ideas are generated based on user prompts.
  - [ ] Ensure human-in-the-loop functionality is responsive.
  - [ ] Validate persistence and retrieval of ideas.
  - [ ] Confirm that streaming displays partial outputs as expected.
- [ ] Debug and resolve any issues.

### **Deliverables**
1. **Functional Backend CLI**:
    - [ ] Story idea generation command.
    - [ ] User feedback and refinement command.
    - [ ] Persistence for storing approved ideas.

2. **Weaviate Schema**:
    - [ ] Schema definition for storing creative writing concepts.
    - [ ] Sample data for testing.

3. **LangGraph Workflow**:
    - [ ] Stateful agent workflow with cycles, branching, and human-in-the-loop integration.

4. **Documentation**:
    - [ ] API reference for endpoints.
    - [ ] Instructions for running and testing the application.

### **Timeline**
- Setup and Configuration: 30 minutes
- Database Initialization: 20 minutes
- LangGraph Workflow Design: 30 minutes
- Backend Development: 40 minutes
- Testing and Debugging: 20 minutes
**Total Time:** 2 hours

---

### **Stretch Goals (Optional)**
- [ ] Implement additional genres and themes for broader idea generation.
- [ ] Add user authentication to personalize idea generation.
- [ ] Enhance the streaming interface with richer feedback (e.g., reasoning explanations).

---

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] The system generates coherent and relevant story ideas based on prompts.
- [ ] Users can interactively refine ideas through human-in-the-loop workflows.
- [ ] Ideas persist across sessions and are retrievable for later use.
- [ ] Streaming responses demonstrate token-by-token idea generation.
